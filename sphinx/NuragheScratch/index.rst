=====================
Discos from Scratch
=====================

Discos is the control software produced for the Sardinia Radio
Telescope, Medicina and Noto. It is a distributed system based on ACS (ALMA Common
Software), commanding all the devices of the telescope and allowing
the user to perform single-dish observations.

If the system has some problems that cannot be resolved with the help
of the previous section, you probably need to restart Discos.
Only specific people can do so. 


**Before restarting Discos, you have to follow the procedure of shutdown
of Discos.**
