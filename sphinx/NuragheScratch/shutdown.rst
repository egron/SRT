Shutdown of Discos
===================

From the **discos-console computer**, close discos :

Close also all the graphic panels, including those related to the active surface, the meteo client and the calibration tool client.


From the **discos-manager computer**, go on the ACS command center and click on ``kill``. Wait the prompt (the graphic panel of ACS will close automatically).
