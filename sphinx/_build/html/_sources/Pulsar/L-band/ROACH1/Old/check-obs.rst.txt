Data quality
------------

#. In the leap0 VNC, go to W3 to check on data quality. Each tab is connected to a cluster node, i.e. a particular 16 MHz sub-band. In each node, go to the data directory:

    ``$ cd /data-001``   for node1

    ``$ cd /data-002``   for node2, etc...


#. In each node, check that the right folders (source and timestamp) are being created and that “dada” files are being written every 10 seconds. If no dada files are being written, there could be something wrong with the IP table.  For example, if one node is malfunctioning (e.g. is turned off) but is listed in the IP table as one would expect, it will cause packet loss or possibly even not write any dada files in the other nodes. In that case, check that all nodes are functioning correctly (see daemons in W1). If the node is definitely not working, you will need to ask a qualified person to look into it [this will involve taking the node out in the IP table before re-starting data acquisition].
      

#. Check the data quality with ``digistat``. Type:

    ``$ digistat *dada`` 

     At the prompt, type ``/xs`` or ``/xw`` then ``ENTER`` 


     The curve on the right should be a nice Gaussian. If not, something went wrong with the receiver or with the cluster. Check that we are indeed observing L-band.

     To exit the plotting, just press ``CONTROL-C``.


#. Check the bandpass using ``passband``. Type:

    ``$ passband *dada`` (then ``/xs`` or ``/xw``) 


     Check for any strange source of RFI. Check in particular the bandpass of node 06. In between 1420 and 1421 MHz you should see the HI line. If it is, the cluster is working properly, giving you the right frequencies.
 
     In addition, you should see familiar sources of RFI. In node 01, you should see the Total Power line at 1375 MHz.



#. At the end of the session, in each node, check for any packet loss with:

    ``$ ~/roach/scripts/packetloss.sh`` 


     It counts how many times the number is not zero, meaning there has been packet loss.

     Occasional packet loss is nothing to worry about. However if the numbers are completely random and the cluster is losing packets in all nodes, we’re in trouble [ask a qualified person to go and manually reset the LEAP switch while data acquisition is  ongoing].



External client
---------------

#. If something goes wrong with the external client (e.g. failing to give you antenna parameters), you should kill (using ``Control-C``) the control.csh code.
 
    Then go see what is wrong with the External Client. If you manage to fix it, re-start: ``./control.csh``.
 
    Failure of the external client does not affect data acquisition with the ROACH while the antenna is tracking. The ROACH keeps recording data. The external client only matters when the antenna is going from TRACKING to SLEWING or from SLEWING to TRACKING.


#. If the external client is not working at all and you need to manually launch data acquisition (i.e. you cannot use the ``./control.csh`` script that is normally used during LEAP to automate data acquisition), you can do the following:

     - at the beginning of the session, set up the ROACH using: ``./control_init.csh`` (W)
     - Use ``./start_simple.csh`` to launch data acquisition (instead of ``./start.csh``) (W)
     - Use ``./stop.csh`` to stop data acquisition without closing the daemons (W)
     - Use ``./start_simple.csh`` for next source etc. (W)
     - at the end of the session, use ``./end.csh`` to stop data acquisition and close the daemons (W)


The difference between ``./start.csh`` and ``./start_simple.csh`` is that ``./start_simple.csh`` does not call the external client to get information about the source. If the external client is working, use ``./start.csh`` and the right folders will be automatically created using the name of the source that is being tracked and the most recent timestamp.


On nuraghe-mng
--------------

#. Check that the data are correctly written in your project section (Rescicom) :

    ``$ cd /archive/data/Rescicom/yyyymmdd``


#. **jlog**

     The logging display shows warning and error messages. Warning
     messages are indicated in yellow while error messages are in red
     |logo| :numref:`srt_jlog`.

     Check the possible error messages. Try to understand the origin
     of the problem and to solve it. In case of persistent/complex
     problem, contact and report the error messages and the associated
     UT time (into the web page .......).


#. **Meteo client**

     Check the wind speed on the Meteo client. If it exceeds 60 km/h,
     the antenna is automatically stowed. |logo| :numref:`srt_windspeed`


     .. On nuraghe-obs1 --------------

#. **Scheduler**

     Check the status of the Scheduler is OK (green).
     During the tracking, @ is green while it is red during the
     slewing of the antenna. |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`

     Check the update of the number of scan/subscan according to your
     schedule (.scd). Scans will be skipped if the target is not
     visible at the moment of the observations.

     If you realize that the scan/subscan number is frozen or that the
     tracking is red while the antenna is tracking the source, stop
     the on-going schedule with:

     ``> stopSchedule``    (in the operatorInput)

     then start again the schedule:

     ``> startSchedule=[projectID]/…scd,n``    (with n the number of scan)


#. **MinorServo**

     Check the status and the tracking are green |logo| :numref:`srt_minorservo_LLP`.


#. **ReceiverBoss**

     Check the status is OK (green). |logo| :numref:`srt_receivers_LLP`


#. **AntennaBoss**

     Check the status is OK (green), the coordinates of the source and
     the beam size value are correct (FWHM in degrees).
     The tracking @ is green when the source is correctly pointed at
     (within 1/10 of the beam), while a red circle appears when the
     telescope is slewing. |logo| :numref:`srt_antennaboss`


#. **Mount**

     Check the commanded azimuth and elevation of the antenna and
     its real position (in blue). The status must be green.
     |logo| :numref:`srt_mount_ok`


#. **Active surface**

     Check that the state of the active surface corresponds to your
     choice (shaped, shaped fixed, parabolic, parabolic fixed). |logo|
     :numref:`srt_activesurface`

     "OK" should be green during the observations.

     Sometimes, not all of the small squares of the active surface are
     green. Do not worry for that if they are spread randomly. Instead, it can be problematic if a
     large fraction (a whole sector) of the active surface becomes
     red, in particular in K-band (see |logo|
     :numref:`srt_AS-fraction-red`).
     Contact the responsible of the observation (observer friend).


Primary Control Panel ACU
-------------------------

Check that everything appears in green (see |logo| :numref:`srt_ACU_green`).
If a red box appears, put the cursor on it and look at the error message.

Contact and report the error messages to the responsible of the observation (observer friend).
