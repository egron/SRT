======================
Important checks
======================

Some checks need to be performed before starting the observations.

On nuraghe-AS (active surface desktop)
------------------

Check that the **active surface** is green (:numref:`srt_activesurface`).
The active surface does not work properly if a large fraction (a whole
sector) becomes red. It is a problem in K-band observations (:numref:`srt_AS-fraction-red`).


On mng-dev (observer computer)
------------------

Check that:
   - the log client **jlog** is open in order to track possible error
     messages (:numref:`srt_jlog`). In case it is not open, type ``$
     jlog &`` on a shell;
   - the interface of the **Meteo client** is open to check the wind
     velocity in real time (it should be < 60 km/h)
     (:numref:`srt_meteo`). If the interface is closed, type ``$
     meteoClient &`` on a shell.
   - all of the **33 containers** are active on ACS (MNG virtual desktop) (:numref:`srt_acs`);


.. warning:: If the number of containers is 0 instead of 33 in ACS, `you have to start ACS <https://srtsupervisoronduty.readthedocs.io/it/latest/sd/srt/procedures/nuraghe.html#avvio-di-nuraghe>`_



.. On nuraghe-obs1 ------------------

On the nuraghe CONSOLE virtual desktop, check the presence of the 8 panels (:numref:`srt_vistaglobale`): 
   - **operatorInput** (:numref:`srt_operatorinput`)
   - **AntennaBoss** (:numref:`srt_antennaboss`)
   - **GenericBackend** (:numref:`srt_genericBackend`)
   - **Mount** (:numref:`srt_mount_ok`)
   - **Observatory** (:numref:`srt_observatory`)
   - **Receivers** (:numref:`srt_receivers`)
   - **Scheduler** (:numref:`srt_scheduler`)
   - **MinorServo** (:numref:`srt_minorservo`)


**Upload your shedules (.scd, .lis, .bck and .cfg files) and check them:**

   *From your computer:*

   ``$ scp  [schedulename.*] discos@mng-dev:/archive/schedules/[projectID]``

   *On mng-dev:*

   ``$ cd /archive/schedules/[projectID]``

   ``$ scheduleChecker [schedulename.scd]``


.. Upload your shedules (.scd, .lis, .bck and .cfg files) and check them :

..   *From your computer:*

..   $ scp  [schedulename.*] observer@nuraghe-obs1:/archive/schedules/[projectID]``

..   *On nuraghe-obs1:*

..   $ cd /archive/schedules/[projectID]``

..   $ scheduleChecker [schedulename.scd]``
